## 🎯 What's NOT Included (Optional Additions)

These are nice-to-have but not required:
- Email notifications
- Image uploads
- Payment integration
- Advanced analytics
- Real-time notifications
- Third-party API integrations

Your backend is fully functional without these!

---

## 🔄 Frontend Integration Ready

### What Frontend Needs to Do
1. Update API URL to `http://localhost:5000/api`
2. Store JWT token in localStorage
3. Include token in Authorization header
4. Handle 401 errors for token expiry
5. Use response format (success, message, data)

### Frontend Files to Update
- `src/services/api.ts` - Set baseURL

That's it! Everything else is handled by the backend.
